## Description

We want to create EZ Eats to help people who live alone, especially students where they tend to order food online or eat out most of the time which ends up in spending significantly more budget on food.

As college students, we saw people around us are also facing these problems and we believe that these people want to save their limited allowances. This problem may seem insignificant, but over time it will have quite a big impact, especially on our finances.
